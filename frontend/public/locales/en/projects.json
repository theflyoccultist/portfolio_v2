    "userresearch1.1": "Before starting the prototypes, I conducted user research within my circle. Finding participants to answer my many questions - aimed at understanding their joys and frustrations, was a real challenge. However, the responses obtained were worth the personal investment.",
    "userresearch1.2": "The people interviewed were at various stages of their transition, with very different types of journeys from one individual to another. But all had steps to anticipate, remember, or needed to know more about.",
    "userresearch1.3": "Whether it was social, medical, or legal affirmation, it could also be difficult to navigate and know the necessary steps of their own journey.",

    "competitiveaudit1": "Competitive Audit",
    "competitiveaudit1.1": "For this particular audit, I wouldn't really choose the term 'competitive' since the project aims to serve the well-being of my community. It would rather be sources of inspiration. I was able to visit information hub-type pages for my website, and I was able to test existing applications that aim for transgender affirmation.",
    "competitiveaudit1.2": "It was on this occasion that I discovered that there was no such application in French, or available in the European territory.",

    "userpersona1": "User Persona",
    "userpersona1.1": "By grouping the results of my initial interviews, I was able to create two personas, Annabelle and Damien. These were personas with different goals, and for the idea of the application and the means I had, Annabelle suited me best.",

    "ideation1": "Ideation Process: Crazy Eights and Homepage",
    
    "lowfidelity1": "Low Fidelity Prototypes",
    "lowfidelity1.1": "During the design of the paper wireframe, I thought of a homepage that grouped all the modules in one place. I stuck with this idea when transitioning to the digital format to offer a simple and intuitive interface.",
    "lowfidelity1.2": "Three main modules structure the page:",
    "lowfidelity1.3": "Photo module: Allows pinning inspiring or personal images. The 'Edit' button facilitates their management.",
    "lowfidelity1.4": "Morning routine: A centralized checklist to track daily tasks (hydration, makeup, etc.), with the possibility of customization via 'Edit'.",
    "lowfidelity1.5": "Long-term checklist: Groups medium or long-term goals (e.g., 'Find a job'), displayed horizontally to differentiate them from daily routines.",
    "lowfidelity1.6": "Finally, to add an extra touch of motivation, a section of inspiring quotes ('Daily Quotes') is integrated at the top of the page. This allows starting the day with a positive thought, while reinforcing the warm and personalized aspect of the application.",
    "lowfidelity1.7": "Regarding the remaining screens, simplicity of use was my first priority.",
    "lowfidelity1.8": "I also expected the user to spend most of their time on the homepage, so I decided to keep the design of the other pages much more minimal.",

    "testresults1.1": "Security: Privacy and data security are particularly important among the candidates. The application should be able to operate locally, without data collection and without an internet connection.",
    "testresults1.2": "Continuity: There were continuity issues that were noticed. This can be resolved by using the same form of buttons for similar themes. For example, 'Edit' buttons should be the same color and shape.",
    "testresults1.3": "Simplification: In the low fidelity version, I had included a 'companies' page that allowed applying for jobs. It was preferable to remove it to ensure the simplicity of my app.",

    "uikit1.1": "Orange represents ongoing tasks and green represents completed tasks.",

    "highfidelity1": "High Fidelity Prototypes",
    "responsive1-pc": "Responsive Website (PC)",
    "responsive1.1": "After completing the high fidelity prototype, I was challenged to also create designs for a responsive website. This is simply a website that adapts to different screen sizes, so it remains ergonomic and easy to read on mobile, tablet, or PC.",
    "responsive1.2": "Since the type of use of my application corresponds more to phones, I decided to see the website as a small corner to promote this mobile app.",
    "responsive1-ios": "Responsive Website (iOS)",
    "responsive1.3": "This prototype shows the final stages of creating a responsive web design, designed to offer clear and intuitive navigation regardless of screen size. The different pages illustrated here (Home, Contact, Info Hub, Our Mission) present a coherent and ergonomic overview for the user, while highlighting the main features of the application.",
    "responsive1.4": "The focus was on a user experience primarily adapted to phones, as the application itself is mainly aimed at mobile use. Each section of the site is designed as a bridge to the application, allowing visitors to discover its objectives, values, and tools.",

    "conclusion1": "Conclusion",
    "conclusion1.1": "Impact: I am happy to have been able to complete this project. I think it allowed me to discover new stories, different struggles that were well worth it. This job fascinates me, and I would like to do more projects like this in the future.",
    "conclusion1.2": "What I learned: Maybe more compassion. Having more courage when asking to conduct usability studies. Realizing that my surroundings were much more enthusiastic about this project than I thought. I will bother them for future studies.",
    "conclusion1.3": "In parallel with my UX design studies, I am taking full stack programming and mobile application development courses. I could try to code this project in an iOS application format.",
    "conclusion1.4": "It is possible that there will be updates to enrich the application with content if it is a project I wish to continue.",
    "conclusion1.5": "I can also think of theme ideas. In the 'Settings' tab of the prototype, there is a theme option, and it might be fun to play with other colors or textures."
