# Portfolio Website

This portfolio website has a Windows XP style layout. Previously using React, it has now been rewritten in htmx, plain HTML, and Ruby. Some people might think it is a downgrade, but it is a steep upgrade performance and personality-wise.

This project is also lightweight, allowing for quick DevOps and cloud deployment practices.
