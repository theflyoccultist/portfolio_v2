    "A single HTML page ? No React dependencies ? Unthinkable!",
    "Wow, no npm install needed. What a concept!",
    "Need help ? Too bad, I was retired in 2007.",
    "I see youâ€™re writing JavaScript. Have you considered a real language ?",

    "You must be a backend devâ€¦ because this UI is hideous.",
    "Oh, you need help ? I bet you didnâ€™t even read the error message.",
