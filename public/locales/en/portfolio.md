#### This Portfolio was designed to regroup all my coding projects into one place.

**Features**

**Windows XP style layout:** Originally, this portfolio was using conventional Bootstrap style components, but due to the lack of personalization, I instead opted for a retro style, Windows XP CSS package.

**A lightweight stack:** To optimize deployment and loading times, the old React portfolio was replaced by a HTMX frontend and a simple Ruby (Sinatra) backend. No more heavy node_modules folder to care about!,

**ERB templates:** To ensure dynamic contents and reduce the amount of JavaScript, I opted for ERB templates to load content dynamically, server-side.

**Robust Deployment:** I have configured a Docker Container and a CI/CD pipeline. If I need to update this website, I simply have to make a new Git push from the code editor, and watch the website being updated live in two minutes.

**Challenges Faced**

**Learning a new programming language:** I had to learn how to write Ruby and use the Sinatra famework, all while making this project. It was fortunately much more intuitive than the TypeScript and React mess that I had been dealing with.

**Leveraging a new Cloud platform:** My old host provider was clunky, and not constructive to my DevOps aspirations. That is why I learned to use the Google Cloud Platform, compatible with Docker Container deployments, and much more open to automation tasks.

**Realizing that I never needed React:** That's right! Due to my focus shifting from Front End web development to DevOps and System Integration, letting go of a framework that was complicating my daily life was a necessary task to ensure ease of maintenance.
