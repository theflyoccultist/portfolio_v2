### Mobile Application for Concert Booking for a Local Concert Hall

### UX Design Portfolio Project

![Looks cool, doesn't it?](https://storage.googleapis.com/theflyoccultist/public/images/simpleplan/simpleplan.webp "Simple Plan")

**The Project:** This application is an interface intended for all spectators who are loyal to a local concert venue. It aims to increase their loyalty by offering simplified access to tickets, discovering new artists, and a notification system.

**The Problematic:** Music lovers with busy lives want to book their tickets more easily and no longer forget a concert they were looking forward to.

**The Objective:** Design an application that simplifies concert booking and reminds them when it is coming up soon.

**My Role:** Lead UX designer for the mobile application.

**My Responsibilities:** Conducting interviews, paper and digital wireframing, creating low and high fidelity prototypes, considering accessibility, and iterating on designs.

#### User Research

To get a better idea of the audience and the features to create for the application, I found six people in my circle to whom I asked a few questions:

- Do you often plan to attend a concert later, only to forget about it? How does that make you feel?
- Do you think these problems (forgetting a plan) can be solved?
- What is the main reason you choose not to go to a concert, even if you have all the possibilities to attend?
- Do you have favorite concert venues, and do you tend to stay loyal to these places?
- How often do you go to concerts? What are the usual motivations that make you attend?

Thanks to the results obtained from these surveys, I was able to identify four pain points.

- Busy Schedule: Too busy with their daily lives, users often tend to forget concerts – hence the need for an application to notify them.
- Loneliness: Even if they are a fan of the artist in question, a person will strongly hesitate to go to a concert if they are not accompanied. In music, sharing is essential.
- Accessibility: Many applications have a color palette that is not sufficiently contrasted, fonts that are too small, or navigation that is too complicated.
- Cost of Outings: It's not just the ticket price, but also the cost of travel or on-site consumption that adds up and often demotivates spectators from going to a concert.

#### User Persona

Based on the surveys and pain points, I was able to imagine two different personas for whom I will adapt my application.

Thus, I present to you Rinko, a young psychology student, wishing to support her favorite musicians despite her busy schedule. I also present to you Angelo, a math teacher with a visual impairment, which does not prevent him from booking and attending concerts.

To address the issues of these two types of users, I decided to develop an accessible and simplified design.,

#### User Map

To better understand the needs of my users, I created a user map that illustrates the different stages of their journey, from searching for a concert to booking tickets.

#### Paper Wireframes

It took several iterations before the digital wireframe stage. I started by drawing the screens on paper, focusing on simplicity and accessibility.

My goal was to develop an interface that is clean, easy to use, so that any user can quickly get familiar with it.

#### Beginning of digital wireframes

Inspired by user research, I was able to stay focused on creating a wireframe that is coherent, easy to use, and has a design with potential for numerous extensions in the future. A geolocation system, artist search by style or alphabetical order, a section for the venue's IT technicians to add new dates, ticket management, contests, and more...

However, I had to restrain myself. For now, I would stick to a ticket booking and registration function, leaving these ideas for future updates. Thus, the homepage focuses on a list of concerts that might interest the spectator.

The digital wireframe for viewing a concert page.

The date, venue, and price are information I deemed necessary to highlight. I added a somewhat unique feature, putting the organizers' profiles at the forefront, just below the concert title. With this, users could easily follow them for future events by these organizations.

The ticket button, seeing this image, I find it too small, and it would be too low to fall right under the hand. Fortunately, I corrected this problem later by increasing the size of this button.

#### Low Fidelity Prototypes

By creating links to navigate through my digital wireframes, I created what is called a low fidelity prototype. The main user journey is that of booking a concert ticket.

This was also a prototype that was tested during my very first user survey.

An overview of navigation through the prototype.

Starting navigation by selecting a date on the homepage. Displaying the date and booking the ticket, confirmation page, and end of journey page, with a button to return to the homepage.

#### Usability Testing

I was able to conduct two usability studies on my prototype.

The first usability study was conducted to see how candidates navigate the main user flow.

The second usability study, conducted on the high fidelity prototype, revealed aspects to refine.

![Before and After](https://storage.googleapis.com/theflyoccultist/public/images/simpleplan/beforeafter1.webp "Before and after")

Participants stated that a payment module was missing after the confirmation page. They also wanted the ability to book multiple tickets in one order.

![Before and After 2](https://storage.googleapis.com/theflyoccultist/public/images/simpleplan/beforeafter2.webp "Before and after 2")

One candidate in particular mentioned that accessibility indications for disabled people were missing. The 'Validate a ticket' button also needed to be renamed, as this screen appears before the ticket ordering process.

Finally, participants suggested adding a search function for concerts and allowing users to filter results by date, venue, and music genre.

#### User Interface Kit

For the colors, I specifically had the idea of an interface where the color purple plays an important role. For me, it is the color of creativity.

#### High Fidelity Prototypes

![Yeah fancy and not a pain to develop](https://storage.googleapis.com/theflyoccultist/public/images/simpleplan/hififull.webp "HI-FI Full")

![Another Gif. The cloud costs are rising.](https://storage.googleapis.com/theflyoccultist/public/images/simpleplan/hifimobile-opti.gif "HI-FI GIF")

Each event card features an attractive image, the title, and essential details such as seating type. The simple and clean design allows quickly spotting key information while offering a smooth and ergonomic experience.

The navigation bar at the bottom of the screen provides quick access to important sections, such as tickets, notifications, and user profile.

#### Conclusion and Next Steps

**Impact:** This application will benefit both concert organizers and users. During the second usability study, most candidates wanted to use it again in a real situation.

**What I learned:** With this project, I was able to learn all the essential steps in designing an application. I initially created my application based on my own experiences, but I later learned to adapt this project to facilitate its use for other people.

- More compatibility with screen readers and tests with visually impaired people, so the application allows access to concerts for everyone.
- A messaging module to allow spectators to get to know each other and make plans before meeting at the concert venue.

After completing the high fidelity prototype and usability studies, I tried to imagine some additional capabilities for a potential version 2.0. These are some ideas I had at the beginning of the app's design.
