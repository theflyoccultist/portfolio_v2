### UX Design Portfolio Project

![Boring app, needs an old school redesign!](https://storage.googleapis.com/theflyoccultist/public/images/evo11/evo11.webp "Evo 11 On App and Google Store?")

**The Project:** Evo11 is a mobile application aimed at helping transgender individuals who need affirmations and a sense of progress in their daily lives. Its development and research were conducted solely within its community.

**The Problematic**: Although there are inclusive resource websites to help transgender individuals learn about the steps of their transition, there is no application to accompany them daily and help them navigate their journey.

**The Objective**: Create a mobile application to help users of this community affirm themselves over time, something that would help them keep track of their small daily progress and victories. 

**My Role:** Lead UX designer for the mobile application and the responsive website for iOS mobile and PC.,

**My Responsibilities:** Conducting interviews, creating paper and digital wireframes, low and high fidelity prototypes, conducting usability studies, responsive design, and considering accessibility.

#### User Research
        
Before starting the prototypes, I conducted user research within my circle. Finding participants to answer my many questions - aimed at understanding their joys and frustrations, was a real challenge. However, the responses obtained were worth the personal investment.

The people interviewed were at various stages of their transition, with very different types of journeys from one individual to another. But all had steps to anticipate, remember, or needed to know more about.

Whether it was social, medical, or legal affirmation, it could also be difficult to navigate and know the necessary steps of their own journey.
        
**Exploration of Identity:**
- How would you describe your gender identity and how has it evolved over time?
- Can you share pivotal moments or achievements related to your gender identity?

**Transition Journey:**
- Which steps of your transition did you find the most difficult?
- Are there specific aspects of the transition process where you would like more support or information?

**Support System:**
- Who has been a crucial source of support for you throughout your gender journey?,
- In what ways do you prefer to receive support from your friends, family, or community?

**Use of Technology:**
- Do you currently use any apps or online platforms for support related to your gender identity?
- What types of features or resources do you find most useful in these apps?

**Challenges and Opportunities:**
- What common challenges do you face in your daily life related to your gender identity?,
- Are there specific situations where you feel the need for additional validation or affirmation?

**Affirmation Preferences:**
- How do you personally seek and receive affirmation and validation of your gender identity?,
- What types of messages or signs of affirmation bring you the most comfort or support?,

**Community Engagement:**
- What types of community activities or events help you feel connected and supported in your gender identity?
- Are there community events, forums, or support groups that you actively participate in?,

**Privacy and Security Issues:**
- How important is privacy and security to you when using apps or platforms related to your gender identity?
- Are there specific measures or features you would like to see to ensure a secure online space?

**Intersectionality:**
- How do other aspects of your identity, such as race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, intersect with your experience as a transgender individual?
- Are there unique challenges or experiences you face due to these intersections?

**Future Needs:**
- What types of resources, services, or support would you like to see developed to better meet your needs as a transgender individual?
- Are there specific areas where you think apps or technologies could be improved to better support the transgender community?

#### Competitive Audit

For this particular audit, I wouldn't really choose the term 'competitive' since the project aims to serve the well-being of my community. It would rather be sources of inspiration. I was able to visit information hub-type pages for my website, and I was able to test existing applications that aim for transgender affirmation.

It was on this occasion that I discovered that there was no such application in French, or available in the European territory.

#### User Persona

By grouping the results of my initial interviews, I was able to create two personas, Annabelle and Damien. These were personas with different goals, and for the idea of the application and the means I had, Annabelle suited me best.

#### Low Fidelity Prototypes

![The App that never was](https://storage.googleapis.com/theflyoccultist/public/images/evo11/lowfiwelcomepage.webp "low fidelity mobile 1")

During the design of the paper wireframe, I thought of a homepage that grouped all the modules in one place. I stuck with this idea when transitioning to the digital format to offer a simple and intuitive interface.
Three main modules structure the page:

- **Photo module:** Allows pinning inspiring or personal images. The 'Edit' button facilitates their management.,
- **Morning routine:** A centralized checklist to track daily tasks (hydration, makeup, etc.), with the possibility of customization via 'Edit'.
- **Long-term checklist:** Groups medium or long-term goals (e.g., 'Find a job'), displayed horizontally to differentiate them from daily routines.

Finally, to add an extra touch of motivation, a section of inspiring quotes ('Daily Quotes') is integrated at the top of the page. This allows starting the day with a positive thought, while reinforcing the warm and personalized aspect of the application.

Regarding the remaining screens, simplicity of use was my first priority. I also expected the user to spend most of their time on the homepage, so I decided to keep the design of the other pages much more minimal.

#### Usability Testing

**Test Type:** Navigation Test
**Location:** Nice and Antibes, France
**Candidates:** 5 people
**Duration:** 1 hour
    
For this study, the low fidelity version of the prototype was tested, helping me determine the necessary revisions to make the application experience more intuitive and pleasant. Here are some findings:

- **Security:** Privacy and data security are particularly important among the candidates. The application should be able to operate locally, without data collection and without an internet connection.
- **Continuity:** There were continuity issues that were noticed. This can be resolved by using the same form of buttons for similar themes. For example, 'Edit' buttons should be the same color and shape.
- **Simplification:** In the low fidelity version, I had included a 'companies' page that allowed applying for jobs. It was preferable to remove it to ensure the simplicity of my app.

#### User Interface Kit

Orange represents ongoing tasks and green represents completed tasks.
Apart from those, I made a deliberate choice to keep the colors minimal.

#### High Fidelity Prototypes

#### Responsive Website (PC)

After completing the high fidelity prototype, I was challenged to also create designs for a responsive website. This is simply a website that adapts to different screen sizes, so it remains ergonomic and easy to read on mobile, tablet, or PC.
Since the type of use of my application corresponds more to phones, I decided to see the website as a small corner to promote this mobile app.

#### Responsive Website (iOS)

This prototype shows the final stages of creating a responsive web design, designed to offer clear and intuitive navigation regardless of screen size. The different pages illustrated here (Home, Contact, Info Hub, Our Mission) present a coherent and ergonomic overview for the user, while highlighting the main features of the application.
The focus was on a user experience primarily adapted to phones, as the application itself is mainly aimed at mobile use. Each section of the site is designed as a bridge to the application, allowing visitors to discover its objectives, values, and tools.

#### Conclusion

**Impact:** I am happy to have been able to complete this project. I think it allowed me to discover new stories, different struggles that were well worth it. This job fascinates me, and I would like to do more projects like this in the future.

**What I learned:** Maybe more compassion. Having more courage when asking to conduct usability studies. Realizing that my surroundings were much more enthusiastic about this project than I thought. I will bother them for future studies.

- In parallel with my UX design studies, I am taking full stack programming and mobile application development courses. I could try to code this project in an iOS application format.
- It is possible that there will be updates to enrich the application with content if it is a project I wish to continue.
- I can also think of theme ideas. In the 'Settings' tab of the prototype, there is a theme option, and it might be fun to play with other colors or textures.
